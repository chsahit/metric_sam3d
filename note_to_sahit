in scenecomplete:
i installed openai, gdown
downloaded grounded_sam_weights (i think this is already done...

  # Activate the scenecomplete environment
  conda activate scenecomplete

  # Install SAM
  cd /home/sahit/metric_sam3d/SceneComplete/scenecomplete/modules/GroundedSegmentAnything/segment_anything
  pip install -e .

  # Install GroundingDINO
  cd /home/sahit/metric_sam3d/SceneComplete/scenecomplete/modules/GroundedSegmentAnything/GroundingDINO
  pip install -e . --no-build-isolation


messed with segment_config.yaml. might need to control that at a higher level
